 <h1>What i've learned so far</h1>
<p> At this point in the course I have learned many things about how to use the bash terminal and basic bash shell scripting. 
    Its basic function is to work similar to a GUI, but more reliable for progamming. In the Terminal I have learned to navigate 
    along a path and use the commands to make directories(which function similarily to a family tree), create files, move, rename,
    and remove files. I've also learned commands to quickly open folders/script files in VScode, and how to set up live servers to test my webpages.
    With the scripting aspect I've learned how to program basic scripts using the bash commands to execute various proccesses like automatically
    setting up directories and creating files while imprinting information into the files as need be. I have also learned how to automatically
    set up a github repository, initialize the folder, add and commit the contents of the folder to the aforementioned repository using the project
    starter script.
